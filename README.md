# build_asp_system
Use Case: Telecommunications Customer Support

Objective: To build an ASP-based question answering system that can assist customer support representatives in providing accurate and efficient solutions to customer queries and issues.

Knowledge Sources:

    Customer Support Knowledge Base: A database containing information about common customer queries, known issues, troubleshooting steps, and resolutions.
    Service Documentation: Technical documentation and manuals related to the company's telecommunications services, equipment, and software.
    FAQs and Troubleshooting Guides: Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting guides provided by the telecommunications company.

Steps in the Question Answering Process:

    Question Parsing: The system parses the customer's question or query using syntactic and semantic analysis techniques to understand its structure and intent. This involves identifying keywords, entities, and relationships within the question.

    Knowledge Base Integration: The parsed question is mapped to relevant entities and relationships in the customer support knowledge base. This involves linking the question to appropriate predicates and rules in the ASP knowledge base.

    Answer Set Computation: The ASP solver computes the answer sets using the knowledge base and the constraints specified in the question. The answer sets represent possible solutions or interpretations of the customer's query.

    Answer Extraction: From the generated answer sets, the system extracts the answer predicates that are relevant to the customer's question. These answer predicates may include troubleshooting steps, configuration settings, service-specific information, or resolution recommendations.

    Post-processing and Interpretation: The extracted answer predicates are post-processed to convert them into a human-readable format. This involves transforming the logical form into a natural language representation that can be easily understood by the customer. The system may also provide additional context or explanations to enhance comprehension.

    Ranking and Selection: If multiple answer predicates are extracted, a ranking or selection mechanism can be applied to determine the most appropriate answer. This can be based on factors such as relevance, confidence, or additional scoring criteria.

    Presenting the Answer: The selected answer is presented to the customer in a suitable format, such as plain text or structured data. If relevant, the system may also provide links to relevant documentation or troubleshooting guides.
